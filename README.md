# GiraffeStar Unity Framework

is an Unity framework to make Unity games easier and faster.

It currently offers

- Event System
- Custom Coroutines
- Configuration Management
- and many more features to come!

Features will be added along as I make progress with my own game, so expect improvements in the future.
